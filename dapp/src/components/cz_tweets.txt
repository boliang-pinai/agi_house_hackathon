I am happy to assist and advise any gov on crypto adoption and regulatory policies if they are genuinely embracing crypto. I offer my advice free of charge, with the only constraint being the time I have available.🙏
"WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't. 🤯

People who become gov witnesses don't go to prison. They are protected.🤷‍♂️

I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.😅"
Chaos and opportunity often come together.
Multiple people have told me again WSJ is writing another baseless hit piece about me. 4 😂

We are in it for the tech, right?😆
It was a good meeting. We probably talked more about education than crypto. I got too excited. But we did talk about crypto.🙂
Crypto doesn't have borders.

"Did you know that Pakistan is the 5th most populous country in the world? With an average age of 24, plus 100% internet coverage, it's an active crypto market.

There are ~20 million kids not in school. @GiggleAcademy could help them learn and get jobs."

"Was a pleasure to have @VitalikButerin drop by our @BNBCHAIN Most Valuable Builder Season 9.

Builders are still building. We are still here.💪"

"I received hundreds of messages through https://t.co/OUOEuB6PYR, which I find incredibly helpful. However, many don't know how to communicate effectively with busy, impatient people like me. Here are some tips.

1. State your ask in the first sentence.

Start by clearly stating your request, like seeking investment, so I know what to focus on immediately. Don’t start with an intro, background, description, and only make an ask in the end. I won’t know what to read for.

2. Make your ask explicit.

Many add vague asks like “would like your support” or “collaboration.” I wouldn’t know what you want. But if you say, “we are raising $500k at a $5m valuation,” it’s clear.

3. Make it concise.

Long messages are easy but show an unorganized mind. Short, concise writing is harder but easier for the reader.

4. Ask precise questions.

Avoid broad questions like "What do you think about the crypto industry?" I address those in media interviews, so searching online for answers is better. Open-ended questions are tough to answer repeatedly.

5. Don’t waste money.

I won’t tell you which coin to buy.
I won’t evaluate a project for you.
I won’t interact with your meme coin just because you asked.
I won’t jump on a call.
I won’t give you crypto. I donate in bulk, but I can’t verify that you aren't a scammer individually.
I won’t follow you just because you asked. It may come naturally.
...

6. If you want to recommend a project to me, you can write concisely why it is good, I will read it.

7. I would greatly appreciate any valuable feedback you may give me, and I will even pay you back.

8. I am looking for builders who can build. I am looking for talent."
"Our industry is in a messy state.

Lots of money chasing quick profits, wanting overnight 10x, 100x returns. When they can't find these, they complain.

On the other end of the spectrum, real builders feel left out. They can't achieve 10x overnight. Building real tangible value takes time.

When others see problems, we see opportunities. Let's help builders build.

@BNBChain, @yzilabs, and @CoinMarketCap have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to gather 16 strong projects to our Most Valuable Builder (MVB) Accelerator Program Season 9. They span AI, DeFi, DePin, DeSci, entertainment, and infra.

Not that I have much to offer, but I will try my best to be a good mentor.

Build!"

"Imagine downloading @TrustWallet and finding your newly generated address is:

0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead

Theoretically speaking, it has the same chance as any other address. 🤷

Alright, enough imagining. Not gonna happen. Get back to building.

Happy Apr 1!"
"Invite friends with kids to a free learning platform @giggleacademy to earn (worthless) points.

Points have no value, and no use case, as of yet. Do it only if you want to help kids learn. 🙏"
"Sent a few high-value tokens (6 or 7 figures) on my address to a burn address. 

There are a few new AI solutions to automate this, but they have not been security reviewed. Will do the rest later.

Please do not send more tokens to the address expecting an interaction."

Low fees.
Eid Mubarak!

99% of people in crypto are here to make a quick buck. 1% are building. Real money is in the latter."

"I will donate 500 BNB each to Myanmar and Thailand.

Is there a transparent on-chain donation system with DID? If not, I will rely on @Binance and @Binance_TH_ to distribute."
I hope everyone is safe in Thailand🇹🇭. 🙏
No one applied for this. Focus on building. Listing comes naturally. #BNB
I am probably the last guy to try this. Not going to change my pfp, as it will put the bluetick into review mode again. And I quite like my current non-ghibli pfp. https://t.co/QjusBXDQR0
"I created a lot of work for myself. Fee was too low, and I had to go through about 200 messages today. I responded to most of the ones I could. Overall, I like the system, I believe it could be a useful tool for many KOLs or professionals.

Also, shout out to @SlowMist_Team for discovering a way to message with a lower amount than specified. It's fixed now. 🙏"
"For all the fees or donations in BNB I receive on my public address, I will donate or use them to help BSC community projects. I may simply buy some tokens with them. It's probably the simplest way to help BSC projects.

For tokens on this address, I will ignore them for as long as I can. Doing anything with them requires effort.😂🤷‍♂️"
"https://t.co/OUOEuB6PYR

18 days ago, I published an article in Binance Square on a Pay to Reach idea. A few days later, a developer messaged me with a working prototype. After some discussions, adjustments, and a security review,   

Yesterday, the product was live. I updated my X profile description last night.

Immediately, I was spammed at the initial price to 0.04 BNB ($24) per message, "yo", "how was your dinner", "check out this meme coin", "which CA?". I can't reply to these types of messages. Please don't waste your money like that.

Then I set the price to 0.1 BNB, but I still woke up with 100+ messages. I have since moved the price to 0.2 BNB, about $120. I will adjust the price to try to hit a sweet spot of about 10 messages per day. I'm not sure if that's even possible.  

Most of the messages I have received are too short or include big questions like "how do I run a successful start-up? " These are hard to respond to.  

I recommend reading https://t.co/umKPjnORZc 

I put this link on the site where they have to write the message to me, but it's clear 95% of the people never read it.

Please don't message me after you see this point. I'm not sure if the server can handle all the traffic. Please read the communication tips, learn the recipient's (my) style, and message effectively. 🙏"
Always good to see deflation.

You might find it hard to fathom, I have never traded Futures on Binance (CEX). Seen many product demos though.😂"
Eliminating MEV. Protect users.
Perps on BSC. High risk, high volatility.

Hiring an intern. @GiggleAcademy is NOT in crypto. Apply only if you are passionate about education.
I see more stablecoin startups than alts. 😂
Free speech is priceless.
"This is awesome! 

1. @GiggleAcademy is distributed by "partners"
2. I learned about this just now, on X. 

No contracts, no discussions. Just a common mission: free education!"
👏
"It's been a year since launching @GiggleAcademy. For most of the year, I was "distracted" by court hearing prep, then "no internet" for 4 months, etc.

Today, we have 7700 kids learning using the app. Larger than a small university. Will continue to build."
